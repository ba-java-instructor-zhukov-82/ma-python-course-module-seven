<p>
    <span>
          Write an object oriented program that show
          building material property and storage quantity:
    </span>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        import data from Lab 2
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the class "Market" based on class “Building”
    </li>
    <li>
        Create class constructor with arguments - material,
        color, number (with default value - 0), store place
        and price
    </li>
    <li>
        All attributes should be get from class Building except price
    </li>
    <li>
        Create method "plus" for adding material quantity by some count
        with corresponding changing to number and place
    </li>
    <li>
        Create method "minus" for decreasing material quantity by some count with
        corresponding changing to number and place
    </li>
    <li>
        Create object for white brick with 300 as initial quantity
    </li>
    <li>
        Create object for brown plank with 20 as initial quantity
    </li>
    <li>
        Print objects variables
    </li>
    <li>
        Add 50 bricks to first object
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove 3 planks from second object
    </li>
</ul>
